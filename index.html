      <p> Add some information about yourself. For now we're happy to know anything you're
      willing to share about yourself (though one thing we are curious about is your programming
      experience before bootcamp). As your progress through your degree at City you will 
      be able to add more here (e.g., interests, skills, experience, a link to a CV). However,
      even then, it's better to keep this information concise (about a paragraph or two)
      and let your CV and the projects below to do the rest of the talking.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: pong game</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of arrays, loops, and randomness. this is a two player game were both players are trying to score in each other areas. in this case player one is hit the ball in players two areas therefore meaning that player one get the point. then the ball resets its postion and then for example player two is hit the ball in players one areas therefore meaning that player two get the point.
